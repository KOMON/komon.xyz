### New blog, who dis?

After going back on forth on all kinds of ways to host a blog with varying
levels of commitment and success, we're now hosting on Netlify with a basic
Jekyll blog. Much credit to Expensify's job application questions; as one of the
companies hiring for PHP in Portland, "What's your website? If you don't have
one, why?" always demanded an answer in my mind. In this day and age there's
simply no reason to not put together something to show and record your learning
and accomplishments.

### New Project

I'm also announcing the beginning of a new, ambitious project. As mentioned, job
postings for PHP in Portland seem to be drying up as the years go on. PHP jobs
that aren't Wordpress, Drupal, or Magento are especially endangered. While
remote jobs exist they are more and more entirely focused on Laravel, which is a
beautiful piece of software don't get me wrong, but a job market entirely
sustained by one framework doesn't bode well for long-term prospects.

So, in answer to that I've decided to extend myself into learning Java. My reasoning:

- Java isn't going anywhere anytime soon, it's an established player with
  established software and companies
- While it has it's warts, it doesn't carry nearly the derision PHP does, which
  means that it's not constantly fighting against that reputation to continue to
  justify its existence
- A good grounding in Java-the-runtime and Java-the-VM can lend itself to diving
  into langauges that are more fun or more modern, like Kotlin, Clojure, and
  Scala
- Knowing Java provides roads out of Web Development in the future, if I so
  desire.
- Big Data as a field is only going to continue growing, and nearly all the
  biggest Big Data tools are written in Java
- Modern PHP is already aping a lot of Java flavor and OOP Design as well, so
  it's not going to be a big leap in terms of philosophy or concept
- Java as a platform is very deep and teeming with opportunity to practice
  wizardry and obtain lore, which are things I value for fun in my work

### Learning in Public

There are many ways to go about learning a new skill, but with the quarantine
and the opportunity working from home with no commute offers me time to perform
an intensive study accompanied with a project to reinforce everything I was
learning.

I plan to grow my twitter network to include more Java folks, use resources
available to me on Stack Overflow, post questions to /r/learnjava, and read a
few books suggested to me by blogs like JavaRevisited.

Because I'm already proficient with OOP and building applications in general,
and I'm already familiar with Java's syntax and general design goals, I plan to
focus on:

- Gaining a breadth and depth of knowledge of the core APIs
- Learn the tooling that surrounds Java development such as test runners, build
  tools, dependency managers
- Gain familiarity with IntelliJ Idea (I personally use Emacs, but it's
  important to have at least a passing fluency with what future colleagues will
  use)
- Deploying Java software for web or desktop use
- Learn some of the more popular 3rd libraries and frameworks, able to read and
  at least know enough to Google effectively next steps for Spring (Boot),
  Struts, Java/Jakarta EE, JavaFX, maybe jOOQ, maybe Spark.

I plan to be taking extensive notes of my readings and of my exercises and will
be posting them to this blog as a way of organizing myself and posing questions
to potential readers and myself.

And most importantly, I thought that building an e-commerce site would be a good
project since e-commerce is a subject I know well and have worked in the depths
of for most of my career. E-commerce provides many opportunities to familiarize
oneself with database access, writing and consuming web APIs, vendor integration
for email and payments. There's concurrency problems with commiting inventory,
and there's questions of order state machines and pricing rules and on and on.
Lots of problems to tackle means lots of opportunity to apply techniques and
figure out new approaches.

Tonight is the first night I plan to formally start, so be on the lookout for
future updates!
